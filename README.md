# MidAtlanticRidgeSeimicity

Hello! This is a Jupyter Notebook I've created at the end of the ["IRIS Seismology Skill Building Workshop"](https://www.iris.edu/hq/internship/) that took place in June 1 to August 31, 2020. It was a great oportunity to enhance my coding skills and have a solid grounding in seismology. 

The course was divided in 6 modules:

1.  Introduction to Linux command line, shell scripting, and basic plot generation with Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) that enables exploration of earthquake patterns in space, time, and magnitude, and Earthâ€™s internal structure based on seismic wave travel times.

2.  Introduction to Seismic Analysis Code (SAC) for viewing seismograms as both waveforms and spectrograms, and conducting time series analysis, filtering, and component rotation that enables detection, characterization, and interpretation of seismic wave patterns.

3.  Use the myriad of IRIS waveform, metadata, and earthquake catalog request tools (e.g., web services, earthquake browser, Wilbur, MUSTANG, etc.) to check data availability and access data that enables exploration of relationships between earthquakes and plate boundaries and earthquake frequency and magnitude.

4.  Use various methods to visualize collections of seismic waveforms for a given earthquake and software for forward modeling and inversion that enables both estimation of subsurface velocity structures and earthquake hypocenter and fault plane solutions.

5.  Introduction to Python and commonly used libraries (e.g., NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and ObsPy) for retrieving, processing, and plotting of data tables and times series that enables rapid scientific analysis of earthquake catalogs and seismic waveforms.

6.  Use existing and create new Jupyter Notebooks with Python to explain and share code with other scientists that enables advanced seismogram processing including removing an instrument response, calculating a spectrogram, and estimating temporal changes in cultural noise.

At the end of the course, we were able to create a Jupyter Notebook and synthesize all our new skills. The aim is analyzing the Central Mid-Atlantic Ridge seismicity over the past 50 years from the events distribution over time. I also did an analysis of a 6.9 Mw event occurred in September 19, 2020. You may find some examples of using numpy, obspy, matplot and pandas.
